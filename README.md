# Group Inventory - Customized Roll20 5e OGL Sheet
Custom edits to roll20's 5e OGL character sheet - includes "group inventory" setup.

Credit to the original creators of the 5e OGL sheet for roll20, their work made it possible to do this...

## Important Info
This is not forked, because I am not yet ready to commit to that main branch and contribute, so this is currently stuck to version 2.7 as per when I made the content. I will update it some more with usability tweaks and patches. For now this is something I'm running for my players, so it does what I need it to!

## Installation
Simply edit the character sheet code on your roll20 campaign's settings and drop the relevant code from each of the files in this repo into the boxes.

index.html -> HTML tab  
sheet.css -> CSS tab  
en.json -> Translation tab  

## How to Use
When you wish to create a group inventory, create a new character as you would normally and give access to the sheet like you would a PC. Under the General Options (cog on the character sheet) select "INV" to toggle the view to a full-page inventory.

Done.

For all intents and purposes, this sheet is a PC just like your players, but the INV option just removes all unnecessary facets to the character sheet and lets you view the inventory without the rest of the page cluttering up your limited screen-space.

* Compenidum Drag-and-Drop compatible (you will need to manually set the compendium to be D&D 5e, of course)
* Carry capacity as per usual - character's strength will be defaulted to 10. Raise STR score if you want to have an upper limit (cart horses, mules, etc)
* Currency now spread along the top for easier view

### TODO:
* Styling
* Weight limit customization
* Size restrictions (with images)
* "Bag of Holding" setting (removes weight limitations, etc.)
